To wrap up Phase 3, you have two things to do:

1. Finish the Social Cards project with your team and have it working in production.
2. Pass a short technical interview on basic React skills.

The project is due by {{site.data.phase3.projects.collaborative_project.due_time }} on {{ site.data.phase3.projects.collaborative_project.due_date | date:"%A, %B %-d" }}. Interviews on on Thursday morning during our regular meeting time.

## Criteria for completing the phase

> - You have made a substantive contribution to the project. A substantive contribution means that you have committed meaningful code in the project repo.
> - Your application meets the minimum requirements detailed in the assignment.
> - Your application runs without errors in production.
> - Your application repo includes a README with a link to your production application and instructions for running the application locally.
> - You can add basic functionality to a small React component during a short individual technical interview.

#### You might not complete the phase if

- You have not made a substantive contribution to the project.
- Your project is incomplete or does not meet the minimum requirements.
- Your project is not running in production.
- You cannot demonstrate basic working knowledge of React during the technical interview.

**If you don't complete the phase, you will not be able to progress to Phase 4.**

## End-of-phase Technical Interview

You will meet with an instructor one-on-one to do a short technical interview. The interview will assess fundamental React skills and your ability to write and run code in your own development environment.

- The code you are explaining is code that you wrote or co-wrote.
- You can demo your code in production.
- You can explain, in specifics, how your code works, with a reasonable degree of accuracy.
- You can comment, in specifics, on what you need to understand better or work on next.

‚≠ê The goal is to demonstrate productivity and working knowledge, not perfection.

### Interview Format & Content

The interview will take about 15 minutes and will require you to do a small code challenge that tests your basic React skills. You'll be given a repo to clone, and you'll do the challenge in VS Code while screen sharing. To pass this interview you need to be able to modify a React component to complete its basic functionality.

Your instructor will let you know at the end of the interview, or shortly after, if you have met the requirements to complete Phase 3.

Interviews will take place on Thursday morning in a breakout room during our regular meeting time.
