The past few months have prepared you to take on the challenges ahead in these next four weeks. You may not _feel_ ready, but you ARE.

At the end of this phase, your team will ship a software product of your own design so that real users can use it and you can show it (and your code!) to potential employers.

## âœ… TODO this morning

1. ðŸŒŸ Read [How we use "ship small" to rapidly build new features at GitHub](https://dev.to/mscccc/how-we-use-ship-small-to-rapidly-build-new-features-at-github-5cl9) for an engineer's perspective on an approach to building software that parallels almost precisely the approach we take in Phase 4.
2. ðŸ’œ [Are you a Chaos Muppet or an Order Muppet? Read this post and **post your personal findings in Slack ðŸ‘€**.](https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/06/chaos-theory.html)

## âœ… TODO this afternoon with your project team

1. **Create a team charter** together and pin or bookmark the document you create in your team's Slack channel. This is an agreement you create together to determine the expectations you have for each other and ensure you can met your goals. Use your experience working on teams in the past to figure out what will help you work together with a **minimum of friction** and a **maximum of productivity**.

2. Brainstorm ideas for your final project with your team, and **be ready to pitch your top two ideas tomorrow morning**.
