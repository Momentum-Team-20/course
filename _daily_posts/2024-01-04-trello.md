#### Your Team's Trello Board

Below is an **invite link** to join your team's Trello board. You may be asked to create a free Trello account once you click on the link to join the board. 

**You have to join the board through this invite link or you will not be able to view the board.**

ðŸ“‹ [Your Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/wPe5PXQc/ATTI3d6056a2a0bf96b21e753644816111b4309B8C5C/team-20)

Your Trello board is ready with columns predefined to start you off. You are welcome to adapt it and create additional columns to support the way your team works.

You should put your user stories on your Trello board in the User Stories column. You'll find a template card for user stories that you can copy ([how to copy a card in Trello](https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/copying-cards-lists-or-boards/#Cards)).

Then, break them down into tasks and put tasks on cards.

### How to make cards

- Task cards go in the Backlog column.
- Use the Task Card template. Please fill out the fields included in the template.
- You can link a task back to its user story card using the User Story field. Remember, one user story may be more than one task.
- One task per trello card
- Each task should be doable in a day or less.
- Don't assign tasks to anyone yet.
- Each card must include how you will know when the task is done (its "definition of done").
