phase: 3

This week you will begin work on a project with teammates. This project must be completed by the end of the phase, on {{ site.data.phase3.projects.collaborative_project.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}.

**In order to successfully complete Phase 3 and qualify for Phase 4**:

- This project must meet the minimum requirements to be considered complete.
- It must be deployed and running without errors in production to be considered complete.
- Each team member must make a substantive contribution to the project. This is best demonstrated through frequent, well-formed commits.
- Each team member must be able to explain how the project works.

We haven't yet covered everything you'll need to be able to do this project, so that will be our task this week and next.

### ðŸ¥… Your Goals Today ðŸ¥…

- Read both project READMEs and decide as a team which project you will do.
- Read your chosen project README again, carefully.
- Understand the project requirements thoroughly and discuss with your team what you need to build.
- Make wireframes and sketch out the user flow (see details on today's topic page).
- Your planning should be documented. You can use any planning tools you find helpful. Some possible tools include Google Docs, Miro, Trello, and Excalidraw. Make sure everyone on your team has access to any planning docs you create. 
- Use [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) to create a new Project in your repo.
- Create code todos for your project as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues). Items you add to your GitHub Project can be converted to GitHub Issues in your repo. These should be detailed and labelled (e.g., "front-end" and "back-end") but DO NOT have to be assigned initially. You may find the [GitHub Issues Quickstart Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart) helpful.

#### By tomorrow each team should have (in writing, diagrams, or sketches)

- A detailed user flow plan/diagram (how your user interacts with your UI; what they do and what happens next)
- Detailed wireframes for each "page" your user will see
- A good initial plan of the components you think you will need
- A list of tasks that need to be done (e.g., "build a component for the login form", "create a component for the user profile page", "create a component for the search form", etc.)
