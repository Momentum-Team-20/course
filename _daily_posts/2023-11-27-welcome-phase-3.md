## How the Advanced Phase Works

During this phase, we'll focus on front-end development using the React.js library, meeting three times a week in 2-hour sessions.

The rest of the day outside of meeting time is project time, so we'll expect to see you online and working. Please let us know if you will be unavailable at any time during work hours.

During project time, please **read/watch/listen to the required readings, videos, and podcasts** and **work on your projects**. Come to meetings prepared to show your progress on projects and ask specific questions.

You are welcome to use your team's Zoom meeting and/or [the co-working Zoom]({{ site.zoom_coworking_link }}) during project work hours.

## ðŸ¤¨ What does "Advanced" Even Mean?

We don't expect you to *know* how to do anything in Phase 3. We do expect you use all the resources at your disposal to *figure it out*.

You can't learn how to code by studying or memorizing. The only way to learn is to *write code* -- and you have to do that before you really understand it. By trying things, and running code, you learn what code does and how it works. Experience is built on doing the work.

## âœ… TODO This Week

_This is the same list of TODOs that you saw at the end of the last phase._

- Read [this overview of what Web Applications are](https://www.robinwieruch.de/web-applications/) for essential context, through "Frontend and Backend". You don't have to read from "Microservices" on, although go ahead if you want to; it is not relevant to what we're doing in Phase 3 but it's good stuff to know about.
    - Answer [these questions about Web Applications to check your understanding](https://forms.gle/k5yJ3aGWLzHkvXqP9)
- Complete this [Goals Reflection exercise]({% link goals_reflection.md %}) to re-energize for what's ahead and focus on what you want to accomplish.
    - Reflect on where you are in this program. You've learned a lot and you have a lot left to learn. What are YOUR goals?
    - Post a tip from your CONTINUE list, or a request for advice for something that you've been struggling with to our team Slack channel.
- **Create a schedule** that you can stick to for the times you will not be meeting with the team. See the [time management][time] references for some suggestions on managing your time effectively.
- Learn [Markdown]
- Pick a [note-taking] application that will let you take notes while you read and work.
