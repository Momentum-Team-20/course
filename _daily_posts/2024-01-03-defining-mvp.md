## ✅ TODO for your project team today

### 1. Post your team charter in your team's Slack channel.

Please pin or bookmark it at the top of the channel so that it can be referenced easily.

### 2. 🗝️ What is your app and what does it do?

Your first and most important goal today is to answer that question. Take into account feedback from pitches, and ask for feedback you need.

### 3. Clearly define your team's Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 🛹 within a prioritized list of features.

Talk through features your app might have and then narrow them down to the most essential. Use the [Product Roadmap slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CfBqu0XJ2nu0YwX3udJ9tulN3CxK8Tdz/view?usp=share_link) for guidance on defining your MVP and prioritizing features.

### 4. Define your users and write user stories for every MVP and nice-to-have feature.

The [Personas & User Stories slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QCvM1hgpDYYdIfQvsfvNxiUztUTWDSyh/view?usp=sharing) will help. This is a necessary step before we will be ready to start planning implementation.
