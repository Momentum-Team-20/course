## 🎯 Objectives

- Review Freeshelf project
- Understand how to create components and work with JSX
- Handling data in React with props and state

## 🏗️ Project: Studio Ghibli Slideshow

Today, you'll start on your first React app from scratch. You'll need to use Vite to create a new React app. This is **due on {{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_slides.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}**.

[React Slideshow project repo]({{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_slides.url }})

🧰 Please be sure that you have installed AND remember to use the [React Developer Tools for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en).

### 🟪 🟨 🟩 Bonus Project: React Memory Game

This is optional. If you are able to find time to work on this, build a [concentration-style memory game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)) using React.

⭐ PRO TIP: This would be a great portfolio piece, and you can style it or theme it however you are creatively inspired to.
