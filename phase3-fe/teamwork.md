## üéØ Objectives

- Plan for collaborative project
- Learn how to work with other developers in a shared codebase

## üèóÔ∏è Collaborative Project

Today we begin the project we'll work on for the rest of the phase. Read [today's post]({% link posts.md %}) for more details.

The project is **due on {{ site.data.phase3.projects.collaborative_project.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}**.

Meet with your teammates and plan the team project. You should have detailed wireframes, an idea of user flow (how your user interacts with your UI), and a plan for components done by tomorrow.

Start with: What does my user see when they first land on this page? What will they do? What happens next? Draw sketches of each "screen" the user sees, and diagram how the UI changes when something happens.

### Team Repo Instructions

Today you will need the project repo so that you can read the README for each project and decide which one you will do. üö´ **No writing code yet**! Today is for planning only.

üîó [Collaborative Project Repo]({{ site.data.phase3.projects.collaborative_project.url }})

**One person** on your team should accept the project invitation and create a new team. Then the other devs should follow the project link and choose their team.

‚ö†Ô∏è You have to use the link above to join the team your teammate created in order to have write permissions to the repo.

**Today you will not commit or push any code since your main goal is planning**.

## How to work as one team

You're working together to ship a product, on time. Dividing up the work requires planning out what you need to build ahead of time. You can make product decisions together even though you will implement features separately, and every developer bears a responsibility for the success of the project.

Communicating well with your teammates is a critical part of this project. You will need to talk and meet with each other frequently so that you aren't duplicating work or building things that won't work together.

**You also are encouraged to work with the other team to share ideas, advice, approaches, and resources.**

Working with other developers in a shared codebase also means that the way you have been using Git and GitHub so far will have to change. This is definitely going to slow you down at first, but it's part of what you are learning in this project.

## Planning User Flow

You will need to sketch out the **[user flow](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows)** and [draw up some **wireframes**](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/wireframing/wireframe-design-101/) for the application. It can help to ask questions like:

- What does our user see when they first land on our site?
- What will they need to do here?
- How will they accomplish that?
- What will happen next?
- If they click on a button or link, what happens?
- What does the UI look like after the user clicks on something / follows a link / submits a form?

**Every developer on the team should be able to answer these questions.** In other words, everyone has to be on the same page and how the app works is everyone's responsibility.
