## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop confidence using state in React
- Render parts of the UI conditionally based on state or props
- Fetch data in React using [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- Learn how to use the `useEffect` hook for fetching and updating data

## 🏗️ Project: React Trivia

This project is due on {{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_trivia.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}. You'll request data from the [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/) to power a trivia quiz application built with React.

- 📖 [Thinking "declaratively" in React](https://daveceddia.com/thinking-statefully/) _The example code uses an older way of writing React components as classes (for example, `this.state` is used with versions of React prior to the introduction of hooks; you won't use this syntax). The concepts are the same, however._
