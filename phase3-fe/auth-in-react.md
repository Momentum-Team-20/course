## 🎯 Objectives

- Understanding what "logged in" means in code
- Implementing token authentication in a React application
- Working with forms in React
- Making POST requests with Axios
- Using local storage with state to store an auth token

## 🏗️ Collaborative Project

Work with your team to get some initial components rendering. You can render components individually just to get them showing up on the page, without completing the conditions to show them or determining the interaction between them yet.

As you are planning out what components you need, you may find it helpful to [read this documentation about Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react).

### Goals by the next meeting

- Your app can make GET requests for questions and answers OR cards and friends.
- Show questions or cards on the page.
- Have at least a solid start on POST requests for creating questions or cards.
- **Deploy to Netlify as soon as possible**.

**PRO TIP** ⭐ Your code needs to run locally with no errors before you can deploy it.

### React Mental Model

Having a _mental model_ for the way a framework works makes it much easier to think and plan your implementation. Review the core concepts of how React works by reading (or re-reading) these visual guides.

### Working with forms, inputs, and local storage

- 📖 [React Mental Models: Working With Input](https://learnreact.design/posts/react-mental-model-html-input)
- 📖 [Introduction to Client-Side Storage](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/introduction-to-client-side-storage-31b103909fb9) This is not specific to React. It explains the storage available in the browser, which we can use no matter how we're building our front-end.
