## 🎯 Objectives

- Check in on project progress and unblock any issues
- Deploy your application to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/with/react/)
- "Ensemble programming" a React application

## 🏗️ Project: React Trivia | React Color Palettes

If you haven't finished React Trivia, you should aim to finish that. It is due on {{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_trivia.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}.

If you have finished it, or finish it early, please do the React Color Palettes project. This project gives you a lot of room for creativity, practice, and experimentation. Depending on how you interpret the requirements, it can be a relatively simple application, or quite complex.

The [React Color Palettes project]({{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_color_palettes.url}}) is due on {{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_color_palettes.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}.

Both projects should meet at least the **minimum functional requirements** and must be **deployed to Netlify.** 🚀
**Please include your production URL in your project's README or on the main page of your GitHub repo.**

## "Ensemble Programming" a React App

Today we will work together to build a React app. We'll be using a technique conventionally called "mob programming", but the term ["ensemble programming" is a bit of a friendlier way to describe it](https://www.lisihocke.com/2021/02/ensemble-is-the-new-mob.html?utm_source=pocket_saves). With this approach, a group of people work together on a single computer to write code. It's a great way to learn from each other and to practice working in a team.

[Here is the repo we'll be working in](https://github.com/Momentum-Team-20/react-team-code). Everyone should clone this it. We'll go over the instructions in the README together.
