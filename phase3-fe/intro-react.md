## 🎯 Objectives

- Review Exercism code challenges
- Learn how React works
- Understand React basic concepts of components, props, and state
- Start a React app from scratch using Vite
- Learn how to use `npm` to install packages and run scripts

## 🏗️ Project: Freeshelf

Today, you'll start on your first React app without a tutorial. Starter code is provided, so you do not have to generate any files. Everything you need to start is already in the repo, and the README includes instructions on how to install dependencies and run the server.

Expect this to be challenging. If you get the basic functionality working, try some spicy options 🌶️.

👉 [React Freeshelf project repo]({{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_freeshelf.url }})

This is **due on {{ site.data.phase3.projects.react_freeshelf.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}**.

## 🛠️ Setup

Make sure you have the following set up in your local environment.

- [Node & `npm`][npm]
