### Custom hooks for local storage

- [useLocalStorageState](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state) _This npm package gives you a custom hook to do what the above article walks you through doing._

## Forms

_See also [JS: Forms][js-forms] and [HTML: Forms][html-forms]_

- [Controlled vs uncontrolled form inputs in React](https://goshakkk.name/controlled-vs-uncontrolled-inputs-react/) _This is a good summary of the two options for forms in React, but be aware that the code examples use the older class syntax instead of function components with hooks._
- [Data Binding in React (Using different form fields and keeping values in sync with state)](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/data-binding/)

## File Upload

- [MDN: File input type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file)
- [MDN: Accessing selected files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/Using_files_from_web_applications#accessing_selected_files)
- [using the FormData object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects) You do not need to use this, but many online tutorials about file upload will show examples using this, and it is helpful to know about.

## Authentication

- [Token Authentication Endpoint guide for djoser library](https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/token_endpoints.html) -> This is the library being used by the backend

## Local Storage and State

- [use-local-storage-state](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state) -> You would `npm install use-local-storage-state` to use it in your code
    - Check out [this custom hook code example](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/), which shows how you could implement this yourself (you could even borrow this code and use it in your project instead of the above library if you wanted to!).
- [Using the Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API) Using local storage without syncing it with state may cause weird bugs, but you should know about the underlying local storage API that is implemented in browsers.

## Deployment

## File Structure

This is _very_ subjective, but there are strategies and organizational patterns that you can follow. You should follow the practices and conventions established by the team that you work with.

For starters, here are two good takes on how to organize your files.

## React Router

### Basics

- [React Router Overview: What It Does and Why We Need It](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview#feature-overview)
- [React Router Official Tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial)
- [How to Set Up React Router and Route to Other Components](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-react-router-version-6/)
- [Learn React Router v6 in 45 minutes](https://youtu.be/Ul3y1LXxzdU)

### General

- [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [React Router Main Concepts](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/concepts) _This is pretty in-depth, and you may not need it, but it's helpful if you want more explanation._
- [A Complete Guide to React Router](https://ui.dev/react-router-tutorial/) _really comprehensive, really good_
- [The Complete Guide to URL Parameters with React Router](https://ui.dev/react-router-url-parameters/)

### Authenticated-Only Routing

Private, or protected, routes are those that are only allowed for logged-in users. You will often want to do this in your application for things like a users' own personal dashboard or a form to create a new resource of some kind.

- [React Router 6: Private Routes (alias Protected Routes)](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-router-private-routes/)
- [Protected Routes and Authentication with React Router](https://ui.dev/react-router-protected-routes-authentication)

## Search

- [Axios Docs: Including search params in the request config](https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config)
- [Blog post on query params with Axios](https://www.kindacode.com/snippet/axios-passing-query-parameters-in-get-post-requests/)

### Filtering existing data in your component

You could also perform a search without making an AJAX request, by filtering data that you already have in React. Here are a couple of examples of how you could do that.

- [Create a search bar from scratch](https://blog.logrocket.com/create-search-bar-react-from-scratch/)
- [How to Build a Search Bar in React](https://www.emgoto.com/react-search-bar/)
- [MDN Array Filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
